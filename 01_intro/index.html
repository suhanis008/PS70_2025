<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Idea 1</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Idea 1

<p class = "margin"></p>

I’ve been speedcubing for the past five years, and I think it would be really cool to design and build a robot that can solve a 3×3×3 cube on its own. Although such robots already exist, creating one myself would strengthen my skills in fabrication and automation. The project would involve using motors to control the cube’s sides, a camera to recognize the color patterns on each face, and an algorithm capable of interpreting the cube’s state and generating a solution. I could either build a robot that solves the cube from the outside or modify a 3×3 by embedding the mechanics inside it. <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcLQKnSThH3i4e-X5_wamxDpI9pKeUPCU&si=LRXjUEhtrfyhcD_b">This is what my idea was inspired by</a>

<h4>Idea 2: Origami Folding Robot</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
I enjoy origami in my free time, and it inspired me to think: what if there were a robot that could fold paper into origami models?  The idea would be to program a set of specific movements, such as making a fold, lifting the paper, or creasing, and then combine them to build different models. Since every model is essentially a sequence of folds, the robot could replicate them step by step. This project would let me integrate robotics with origami while exploring how to design arm mobility for precise movements. Origami models can be grouped into categories, <a href="https://origami-resource-center.com/origami-classification/">like these</a> , based on the complexity of their folds. To begin, I would focus on the most basic category, 2D models, and program the robot with the fold types needed to complete any design in that category. <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcLQKnSThH3i4e-X5_wamxDpI9pKeUPCU&si=LRXjUEhtrfyhcD_b">This is a link to some existing models.</a> The diagram below shows more of the building process I have in mind.

<h4>Idea 3: Drone with collapsible arms</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Last summer at the Research Science Institute, I conducted research on deployable structures and have been fascinated with them ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/mVd_uz3b7zI">This is a link to the prototypes I made.</a> I believe drones equipped with deployable arms could be highly effective for transporting materials to locations that are otherwise difficult to access. For this project, I would need to study the aerodynamics of conventional drones, learn how to construct one, and then determine the modifications required to ensure that the extendable arm does not disrupt the drone’s balance while still allowing it to fly effectively. <br>
