<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Kinetic Sculpture</h4>

For my kinetic sculpture, I created a moving sign that says “PS 70 is the Best!” which goes up and down as the motor rotates.
At first, I wanted to make a hand that would rise and fall through the hole in the box. But during testing, I realized that the hand often slipped all the way through, which caused the sculpture to fail.

To fix this, I replaced the hand with a sign. The sign only moves up and down without disappearing into the box, which solved the problem. I experimented with different circle radii to make the motion smooth, and I also had to make sure the base was wide enough to roll off the circle properly.

Once the mechanism worked by hand, I built a mount for the motor so it would stay in place while driving the movement.

Here is a video of my kinetic sculpure in motion!
