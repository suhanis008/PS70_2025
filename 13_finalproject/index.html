<h3>Final Project: Automated Origami Folding Machine</h3>

<p class="margin"></p>

<h4>Purpose of My Project</h4>
My final project aims to automate the process of folding origami. The purpose is to explore how a machine can create a clean, consistent crease using mechanics and electronics, which turns out to be much more complex than it looks.
<p class="margin"></p>

<h4>From MVP Week to Final Project</h4>
From MVP week, I realized I needed a stronger hinge, better torque, and a structure that wouldn’t shift. For the final project, I redesigned the hinge, used a stronger servo, added a holding mechanism, and rebuilt the system using plywood boxes instead of cardboard.
<p class="margin"></p>

<h4>Better Hinge Design</h4>
I redesigned the hinge to increase wall thickness, improve tolerances, and prevent cracking.

<h4>Stronger Servo and Screw Attachment</h4>
I upgraded to a stronger servo and switched to a screw-mounted arm for a more secure connection.

<h4>Thread Linkage and Holding Mechanism</h4>
One issue in the MVP was that I needed to tape the paper onto the hinge for every fold. This prevented the system from being semi-autonomous. So I designed a holding arm mechanism for a second servo, and shifted to a hinge with a larger gap so the mechansim could sit in between.

<p class="margin"></p>


I also attached a thread between the folding servo arm and hinge that could bring the hinge down after every fold.


<h4>Paper Choice and Support Box</h4>
Thick paper did not fold well because the folding arm was open on one end.

Normal printer paper performed much better.

However, I had to hold the motors down. I later upgraded to a wider holding mechanism.

<h4>Electronics and Code</h4>
I switched from an ESP32 to a Xiao board, since my ESP32 somehow broke in between. This gave me good soldering practice. I controlled two servos: one for holding and one for folding. This is the code that I used:

<p class="margin"></p>

<pre><code>
#include &lt;ESP32Servo.h&gt;

Servo myservofold;  // create servo object to control a servo
Servo myservohold; 
int Fpos = 0; 
int Hpos = 120;   // variable to store the servo position.
int ButtonPinFold = D7;
int ServoPinFold = D8;
int ServoPinHold = D9;

void setup() {
  myservofold.attach(ServoPinFold);
  myservofold.write(Fpos);
  myservohold.attach(ServoPinHold);
  myservohold.write(Hpos);
  pinMode(ButtonPinFold, INPUT_PULLUP);
  Serial.begin(9600); 
}

void loop() {
  int ButtonStateFold = digitalRead(ButtonPinFold);
  Serial.println(ButtonStateFold);

  if (ButtonStateFold == LOW) {   
    
    myservohold.write(175);
    delay(1000);

    myservofold.write(118);
    delay(1000);

    myservohold.write(175);
    delay(1000); 

    myservofold.write(118);
    delay(1000);

    myservofold.write(0);
    delay(1000);
    
    myservohold.write(120);
    delay(1000);
   
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Moving from Cardboard to Plywood</h4>
Cardboard wasn’t strong enough, and since the motors were just secured with double sided tape they kepy moving a lot. I decided to shift to finger-joint plywood boxes. I prototyped measurements using cardboard and then laser-cut 6mm plywood using MakerCase. The 0.18mm kerf made the finger joints tight enough to hammer-fit without glue.

<h4>Motor Mounts and L-Joints</h4>
I took measurements of the motor and designed a L-joint to hold it down. I drilled on the plywood to fit screws through it to mount the motors securely. Experimenting with different measurements took some time.

After sanding the plywood, I attached the boxes together and taped the hinge onto the surface.

<h4>Switch Mount and Base</h4>
I soldered a switch and 3D printed a small mount so it could be pressed from the front. Then I attached the whole mechanism onto a plywood base for stability.

<h4>Further Work</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Reduce the hinge gap for sharper folds</li>
  <li>Thin the holding mechanism while keeping it stable</li>
  <li>Add a tiny motorized roller to advance the paper</li>
  <li>Explore multiple sequential folds</li>
</ul>

<h4>End Thoughts on the Term</h4>
I am very proud of how this project turned out. I spent several hours in the makerpsace through out the term working on it and I feel very happy! I am so glad I took this class. This was my first time building a complete mechanical–electronic system from scratch. I learned how long even simple tasks can take, and I’m extremely grateful to Nathan, Bobby, Kassia, Jessica, Alyssa, and the TF team for all their support. I will miss this class, but I’m glad I can always return to the makerspace.
