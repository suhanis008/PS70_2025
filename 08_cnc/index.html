<h3>Week 8: CNC Milling</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>


<h4>1. Design Something and Make It Using CNC</h4>

For this part of the assignment, I wanted to create a birthday present for my friend, a jewelry tray. I started by designing the model in Fusion 360.

I then used ASPIRE and ShopBot to cut the design on the CNC machine.

<p class = "margin"></p>

This is how the initial piece came out:

<p class = "margin"></p>

After sanding it down, it looked much smoother:

Finally, I applied a shellac finish to give it a polished look. Here’s the final result. I hope my friend likes it.

<h4>Second Iteration: Harvard “H” Jewelry Tray</h4>

After gaining some experience with the ShopBot, I wanted to make something more complex, an irregular-shaped jewelry tray featuring the Harvard “H” logo in the center. Here’s what the 3D model looked like in Fusion 360:

I had faced issues with the Join command in Aspire while working on my previous model. This time, with Bobby’s guidance, I created a full 3D model and projected it onto a plane to get a single connected sketch. I used pocket cuts so that the middle “H” would sit lower than the surrounding edges. Here’s how it looked after cutting it on the ShopBot:

One section of the wood turned out to be hollow, so I filled it with wood filler and later reinforced it with wood glue.

<h4>2. Post-Processing the Design</h4>

Once the tray was fully sanded, I used vacuum forming to create a mold.

This is how the mold turned out:

Inspired by Kassia’s swirly paint designs on the state plates, I decided to experiment with swirled color effects for my plaster casting. After mixing the plaster powder and water in the correct ratio, I added a few drops of blue paint to achieve a marbled look.

<p class = "margin"></p>

<img src="./paint_swirl.jpg" alt="generic placeholder image" width = "400" height = "400">

<p class = "margin"></p>

Then, I poured the mixture into the mold:

<p class = "margin"></p>

<img src="./H_cast.jpg" alt="generic placeholder image" width = "400" height = "400">

<p class = "margin"></p>


After removing it from the mold, I was really happy with how it turned out. The swirls gave it a beautiful finish. I have really enjoyed learning how to use the CNC machine, and I look forward to experimenting with it more in future projects.
